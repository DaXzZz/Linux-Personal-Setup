Fix NTFS Mount Error (Windows Hibernation or Corruption)
========================================================

❌ Common Error:
- Failed to mount NTFS volume
- Message: "Windows is hibernated, refused to mount" or "bad superblock"

✅ Step-by-Step Fix:

🔍 1. Check the filesystem type:

   sudo blkid /dev/nvme0n1p3

   -> Shows if it's ntfs, ext4, etc.

🧰 2. Install tools (for NTFS):

   sudo pacman -S ntfs-3g

🛠 3. Run filesystem check:

   - For NTFS:
     sudo ntfsfix /dev/nvme0n1p3

   - For ext4:
     sudo fsck /dev/nvme0n1p3

⚡ 4. If the issue is "Windows is hibernated":

   (Recommended method from Windows)

   - Boot into Windows
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
     powercfg /h off
     shutdown /s /f /t 0

   -> This disables Fast Startup and fully shuts down Windows.

🚀 5. Mount manually:

   sudo mkdir -p /mnt/ntfsdrive
   sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt/ntfsdrive

📌 Notes:
- You can name /mnt/ntfsdrive anything you want
- GUI file managers may auto-mount to /run/media/<user>/...
- For auto-mount at boot, add an entry to /etc/fstab
